1. Open Xampp.

2. Stop all the running Xampp services.

3. Go to "config" at top-right corner of the Xampp window, click on "service and port settings", go to "mysql" tab and change the "main port" to 3308 or something else.

4. Now, in Xampp, click on "config" in the MySql row (click on MySql's "config"), and open "my.ini".

5. "my.ini" will open in notepad. Go to line 20 (Can be some other line also) and change the port to 3308, like this:

# password = your_password

port = 3308

…

6. Also, change the port to 3308 on line 28 of my.ini file, like this:

# The MySQL server

[mysqld]

port= 3308

…

7. Save the changes.

8. Restart the Xampp.

9. Now go to C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin (Your directory where Xampp is installed) . Open the "config.inc.php" file.

10. Below the user, password and extension lines at the top of the file(Below line 23), add this line:

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = 3308;

(If you don't follow step 10, this error will occur while opening "phpmyadmin": (HY000/2002): No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.)

11. Save the changes.

12. Also, from now, in your every new project, you have to mention this new port in your project code :

//After changing the port:

//Connecting Mysql Database with PHP:

$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost:3308" , "root" , "", "database_name");

That’s it.

Cheers!
